React.js demo for DF14

## Requirements
* [node](http://nodejs.org)
* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

Once you have node and gulp installed, you'll need to run npm install

```bash
$ npm install
```

This will install all of the module dependencies. Then to run the build you just need to run gulp's default task.

```bash
$ gulp
```

This compiles the assets and creates the static resource in the proper directory inside of `src/`. Then just deploy as you normally would using your preferred Salesforce deployment tool.
