React.js demo for DF14

To build the client-side assets, you'll need to install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

Then just run it

```bash
$ gulp
```

This compiles the assets and creates the static resource in the proper directory inside of `src/`. Then just deploy as you normally would using your preferred Salesforce deployment tool.
